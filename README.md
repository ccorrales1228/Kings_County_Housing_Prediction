## Overview
This project will focus on data gathering and analysis to aid Microsoft's business stakeholders on their new venture into the box office space. We gatherd our usable data from both [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/?ref_=bo_nb_cso_mojologo) and [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/?ref_=nv_home) so generate a descriptive analysis on how best Microsoft can optimize their debut for the most success. 

## Business Problem
Predicting price of house within Kings County, WA

The question i will be asking myself throughout this process: What do most people interested in buy a home look for?

## Data
id - unique ID for a house
date - Date day house was sold
price - Price is prediction target
bedrooms - Number of bedrooms
bathrooms - Number of bathrooms
sqft_living - square footage of the home
sqft_lot - square footage of the lot
floors - Total floors (levels) in house
waterfront - ‘1’ if the property has a waterfront, ‘0’ if not.
view - Number of times house has been viewed
condition - Condition of the house, ranked from 1 to 5
grade - Classification by construction quality which refers to the types of materials used and the quality of workmanship. Buildings of better quality (higher grade) cost more to build per unit of measure and command higher value.
sqft_above - square footage of house (apart from basement)
sqft_basement - square footage of the basement
yr_built - Year when house was built
yr_renovated - Year when house was renovated
zipcode - zip code in which house is located
lat - Latitude coordinate
long - Longitude coordinate
sqft_living15 - Average size of interior housing living space for the closest 15 houses, in square feet
sqft_lot15 - Average size of land lost for the closest 15 houses, in square feet


## Methods
This projected uses exploratory data analysis to find realtionships between the data and apply statistical test and inferences to see out any irregularties or extreme values.
Next, we will run linear regresion models to see if potential features created/engineered will help to optimize performance of our model to predict price on our test set. 
After the modeling process, we will then apply feature selection methods help reduce highly correclated features and see if performance increases.

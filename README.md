## Business Problem
Predicting price of house within Kings County, WA


The question I will be asking myself throughout this process: What do most people interested in buy a home look for?


## Data
* **id** - unique ID for a house
* **date** - Date day house was sold
* **price** - Price is prediction target
* **bedrooms** - Number of bedrooms
* **bathrooms** - Number of bathrooms
* **sqft_living** - square footage of the home
* **sqft_lot** - square footage of the lot
* **floors** - Total floors (levels) in house
* **waterfront** - Whether house has a view to a waterfront
* **view** - Number of times house has been viewed
* **condition** - How good the condition is (overall)
* **grade** - overall grade given to the housing unit, based on King County grading system
* **sqft_above** - square footage of house (apart from basement)
* **sqft_basement** - square footage of the basement
* **yr_built** - Year when house was built
* **yr_renovated** - Year when house was renovated
* **zipcode** - zip code in which house is located
* **lat** - Latitude coordinate
* **long** - Longitude coordinate
* **sqft_living15** - The square footage of interior housing living space for the nearest 15 neighbors
* **sqft_lot15** - The square footage of the land lots of the nearest 15 neighbors


## Methods
This project uses exploratory data analysis to find realtionships between the data and apply statistical test and inferences to see out any irregularties or extreme values.
Next, we will run linear regresion models to see if potential features created/engineered will help to optimize performance of our model to predict price on our test set. 
After the modeling process, we will then apply feature selection methods help reduce highly correclated features and see if performance increases.
